      "\n",
      "   The two men were slowly pacing the terrace in front of Dr.\n",
      "   Raymond’s house. The sun still hung above the western\n",
      "   mountain-line, but it shone with a dull red glow that cast no\n",
      "   shadows, and all the air was quiet; a sweet breath came from\n",
      "   the great wood on the hillside above, and with it, at\n",
      "   intervals, the soft murmuring call of the wild doves. Below, in\n",
      "   the long lovely valley, the river wound in and out between the\n",
      "   lonely hills, and, as the sun hovered and vanished into the\n",

      "   long, a pang of sudden joy thrilled my soul, and I knew the\n",
      "   long journey was at an end. By what seemed then and still seems\n",
      "   a chance, the suggestion of a moment’s idle thought followed up\n",

      "   times already, the great truth burst upon me, and I saw, mapped\n",

      "   continents and islands, and great oceans in which no ship has\n",
      "   sailed (to my belief) since a Man first lifted up his eyes and\n",
      "   beheld the sun, and the stars of heaven, and the quiet earth\n",
      "   beneath. You will think this all high-flown language, Clarke,\n",
      "   but it is hard to be literal. And yet; I do not know whether\n",
      "   what I am hinting at cannot be set forth in plain and lonely\n",
      "   terms. For instance, this world of ours is pretty well girded\n",
      "   now with the telegraph wires and cables; thought, with\n",
      "   something less than the speed of thought, flashes from sunrise\n",
      "   to sunset, from north to south, across the floods and the\n",
      "   desert places. Suppose that an electrician of today were\n",
      "   suddenly to perceive that he and his friends have merely been\n",
      "   playing with pebbles and mistaking them for the foundations of\n",
      "   the world; suppose that such a man saw uttermost space lie open\n",
      "   before the current, and words of men flash forth to the sun and\n",
      "   beyond the sun into the systems beyond, and the voice of\n",
      "   articulate-speaking men echo in the waste void that bounds our\n",
      "   thought. As analogies go, that is a pretty good analogy of what\n",
      "   I have done; you can understand now a little of what I felt as\n",
      "   I stood here one evening; it was a summer evening, and the\n",
      "   valley looked much as it does now; I stood here, and saw before\n",
      "   me the unutterable, the unthinkable gulf that yawns profound\n",
      "   between two worlds, the world of matter and the world of\n",
      "   spirit; I saw the great empty deep stretch dim before me, and\n",
      "   in that instant a bridge of light leapt from the earth to the\n",
      "   unknown shore, and the abyss was spanned. You may look in\n",

      "   Raymond went to the stone slab, and Clarke watched him drearily\n",
      "   as he bent over a row of phials and lit the flame under the\n",

      "   in the shadows, looked down at the great shadowy room,\n",
      "   wondering at the bizarre effects of brilliant light and\n",
      "   undefined darkness contrasting with one another. Soon he became\n",

      "   odour, in the room, and as it grew more decided he felt\n",
      "   surprised that he was not reminded of the chemist’s shop or the\n",
      "   surgery. Clarke found himself idly endeavouring to analyse the\n",
      "   sensation, and half conscious, he began to think of a day,\n",
      "   fifteen years ago, that he had spent roaming through the woods\n",
      "   and meadows near his own home. It was a burning day at the\n",
      "   beginning of August, the heat had dimmed the outlines of all\n",
      "   things and all distances with a faint mist, and people who\n",
      "   observed the thermometer spoke of an abnormal register, of a\n",
      "   temperature that was almost tropical. Strangely that wonderful\n",
      "   hot day of the fifties rose up again in Clarke’s imagination;\n",
      "   the sense of dazzling all-pervading sunlight seemed to blot out\n",
      "   the shadows and the lights of the laboratory, and he felt again\n",
      "   the heated air beating in gusts about his face, saw the shimmer\n",

      "   himself from his lethargy. He could only think of the lonely\n",
      "   walk he had taken fifteen years ago; it was his last look at\n",
      "   the fields and woods he had known since he was a child, and now\n",
      "   it all stood out in brilliant light, as a picture, before him.\n",
      "   Above all there came to his nostrils the scent of summer, the\n",

      "   shaded places, deep in the green depths, drawn forth by the\n",
      "   sun’s heat; and the scent of the good earth, lying as it were\n",
      "   with arms stretched forth, and smiling lips, overpowered all.\n",
      "   His fancies made him wander, as he had wandered long ago, from\n",
      "   the fields into the wood, tracking a little path between the\n",
      "   shining undergrowth of beech-trees; and the trickle of water\n",
      "   dropping from the limestone rock sounded as a clear melody in\n",
      "   the dream. Thoughts began to go astray and to mingle with other\n",
      "   thoughts; the beech alley was transformed to a path between\n",
      "   ilex-trees, and here and there a vine climbed from bough to\n",
      "   bough, and sent up waving tendrils and drooped with purple\n",
      "   grapes, and the sparse grey-green leaves of a wild olive-tree\n",
      "   stood out against the dark shadows of the ilex. Clarke, in the\n",
      "   deep folds of dream, was conscious that the path from his\n",

      "   was wondering at the strangeness of it all, when suddenly, in\n",
      "   place of the hum and murmur of the summer, an infinite silence\n",
      "   seemed to fall on all things, and the wood was hushed, and for\n",
      "   a moment in time he stood face to face there with a presence,\n",
      "   that was neither man nor beast, neither the living nor the\n",
      "   dead, but all things mingled, the form of all things but devoid\n",
      "   of all form. And in that moment, the sacrament of body and soul\n",
      "   was dissolved, and a voice seemed to cry “Let us go hence,” and\n",

      "   When Clarke woke up with a start he saw Raymond pouring a few\n",

      "   see the walls of the laboratory melt and disappear, and to\n",
      "   awake in London, shuddering at his own sleeping fancies. But at\n",
      "   last the door opened, and the doctor returned, and behind him\n",
      "   came a girl of about seventeen, dressed all in white. She was\n",
      "   so beautiful that Clarke did not wonder at what the doctor had\n",
      "   written to him. She was blushing now over face and neck and\n",
      "   arms, but Raymond seemed unmoved.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “Mary,” he said, “the time has come. You are quite free. Are\n",

      "\n",
      "   “Yes, dear, quite ready. Give me a kiss before you begin.”\n",
      "\n",
      "   The doctor stooped and kissed her mouth, kindly enough. “Now\n",
      "   shut your eyes,” he said. The girl closed her eyelids, as if\n",
      "   she were tired, and longed for sleep, and Raymond placed the\n",
      "   green phial to her nostrils. Her face grew white, whiter than\n",
      "   her dress; she struggled faintly, and then with the feeling of\n",
      "   submission strong within her, crossed her arms upon her breast\n",
      "   as a little child about to say her prayers. The bright light of\n",
      "   the lamp fell full upon her, and Clarke watched changes\n",
      "   fleeting over her face as the changes of the hills when the\n",
      "   summer clouds float across the sun. And then she lay all white\n",
      "   and still, and the doctor turned up one of her eyelids. She was\n",
      "   quite unconscious. Raymond pressed hard on one of the levers\n",
      "   and the chair instantly sank back. Clarke saw him cutting away\n",
      "   a circle, like a tonsure, from her hair, and the lamp was moved\n",
      "   nearer. Raymond took a small glittering instrument from a\n",
      "   little case, and Clarke turned away shudderingly. When he\n",
      "   looked again the doctor was binding up the wound he had made.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “She will awake in five minutes.” Raymond was still perfectly\n",
      "   cool. “There is nothing more to be done; we can only wait.”\n",
      "\n",
      "   The minutes passed slowly; they could hear a slow, heavy,\n",
      "   ticking. There was an old clock in the passage. Clarke felt\n",
      "   sick and faint; his knees shook beneath him, he could hardly\n",
      "   stand.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Suddenly, as they watched, they heard a long-drawn sigh, and\n",
      "   suddenly did the colour that had vanished return to the girl’s\n",
      "   cheeks, and suddenly her eyes opened. Clarke quailed before\n",
      "   them. They shone with an awful light, looking far away, and a\n",
      "   great wonder fell upon her face, and her hands stretched out as\n",
      "   if to touch what was invisible; but in an instant the wonder\n",
      "   faded, and gave place to the most awful terror. The muscles of\n",
      "   her face were hideously convulsed, she shook from head to foot;\n",
      "   the soul seemed struggling and shuddering within the house of\n",
      "   flesh. It was a horrible sight, and Clarke rushed forward, as\n",
      "   she fell shrieking to the floor.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Three days later Raymond took Clarke to Mary’s bedside. She was\n",
      "   lying wide-awake, rolling her head from side to side, and\n",
      "   grinning vacantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "   “Yes,” said the doctor, still quite cool, “it is a great pity;\n",
      "   she is a hopeless idiot. However, it could not be helped; and,\n",

      "MR. CLARKE’S MEMOIRS\n",
      "\n",
      "   Mr. Clarke, the gentleman chosen by Dr. Raymond to witness the\n",
      "   strange experiment of the god Pan, was a person in whose\n",
      "   character caution and curiosity were oddly mingled; in his\n",
      "   sober moments he thought of the unusual and eccentric with\n",
      "   undisguised aversion, and yet, deep in his heart, there was a\n",
      "   wide-eyed inquisitiveness with respect to all the more\n",
      "   recondite and esoteric elements in the nature of men. The\n",
      "   latter tendency had prevailed when he accepted Raymond’s\n",
      "   invitation, for though his considered judgment had always\n",
      "   repudiated the doctor’s theories as the wildest nonsense, yet\n",
      "   he secretly hugged a belief in fantasy, and would have rejoiced\n",
      "   to see that belief confirmed. The horrors that he witnessed in\n",
      "   the dreary laboratory were to a certain extent salutary; he was\n",
      "   conscious of being involved in an affair not altogether\n",
      "   reputable, and for many years afterwards he clung bravely to\n",
      "   the commonplace, and rejected all occasions of occult\n",
      "   investigation. Indeed, on some homeopathic principle, he for\n",
      "   some time attended the seances of distinguished mediums, hoping\n",
      "   that the clumsy tricks of these gentlemen would make him\n",
      "   altogether disgusted with mysticism of every kind, but the\n",
      "   remedy, though caustic, was not efficacious. Clarke knew that\n",
      "   he still pined for the unseen, and little by little, the old\n",
      "   passion began to reassert itself, as the face of Mary,\n",
      "   shuddering and convulsed with an unknown terror, faded slowly\n",
      "   from his memory. Occupied all day in pursuits both serious and\n",
      "   lucrative, the temptation to relax in the evening was too\n",
      "   great, especially in the winter months, when the fire cast a\n",
      "   warm glow over his snug bachelor apartment, and a bottle of\n",
      "   some choice claret stood ready by his elbow. His dinner\n",
      "   digested, he would make a brief pretence of reading the evening\n",
      "   paper, but the mere catalogue of news soon palled upon him, and\n",
      "   Clarke would find himself casting glances of warm desire in the\n",
      "   direction of an old Japanese bureau, which stood at a pleasant\n",
      "   distance from the hearth. Like a boy before a jam-closet, for a\n",
      "   few minutes he would hover indecisive, but lust always\n",
      "   prevailed, and Clarke ended by drawing up his chair, lighting a\n",
      "   candle, and sitting down before the bureau. Its pigeon-holes\n",
      "   and drawers teemed with documents on the most morbid subjects,\n",
      "   and in the well reposed a large manuscript volume, in which he\n",
      "   had painfully entered the gems of his collection. Clarke had a\n",
      "   fine contempt for published literature; the most ghostly story\n",
      "   ceased to interest him if it happened to be printed; his sole\n",
      "   pleasure was in the reading, compiling, and rearranging what he\n",
      "   called his “Memoirs to prove the Existence of the Devil,” and\n",
      "   engaged in this pursuit the evening seemed to fly and the night\n",
      "   appeared too short.\n",
      "\n",
      "   On one particular evening, an ugly December night, black with\n",
      "   fog, and raw with frost, Clarke hurried over his dinner, and\n",
      "   scarcely deigned to observe his customary ritual of taking up\n",
      "   the paper and laying it down again. He paced two or three times\n",
      "   up and down the room, and opened the bureau, stood still a\n",
      "   moment, and sat down. He leant back, absorbed in one of those\n",
      "   dreams to which he was subject, and at length drew out his\n",
      "   book, and opened it at the last entry. There were three or four\n",
      "   pages densely covered with Clarke’s round, set penmanship, and\n",
      "   at the beginning he had written in a somewhat larger hand:\n",
      "\n",
      "   Singular Narrative told me by my Friend, Dr. Phillips. He\n",
      "   assures me that all the facts related therein are strictly and\n",

      "   Persons Concerned, or the Place where these Extraordinary\n",
      "   Events occurred.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Mr. Clarke began to read over the account for the tenth time,\n",
      "   glancing now and then at the pencil notes he had made when it\n",
      "   was told him by his friend. It was one of his humours to pride\n",
      "   himself on a certain literary ability; he thought well of his\n",
      "   style, and took pains in arranging the circumstances in\n",
      "   dramatic order. He read the following story:—\n",
      "\n",
      "   The persons concerned in this statement are Helen V., who, if\n",
      "   she is still alive, must now be a woman of twenty-three, Rachel\n",
      "   M., since deceased, who was a year younger than the above, and\n",
      "   Trevor W., an imbecile, aged eighteen. These persons were at\n",
      "   the period of the story inhabitants of a village on the borders\n",
      "   of Wales, a place of some importance in the time of the Roman\n",
      "   occupation, but now a scattered hamlet, of not more than five\n",
      "   hundred souls. It is situated on rising ground, about six miles\n",
      "   from the sea, and is sheltered by a large and picturesque\n",
      "   forest.\n",
      "\n",
      "   Some eleven years ago, Helen V. came to the village under\n",
      "   rather peculiar circumstances. It is understood that she, being\n",
      "   an orphan, was adopted in her infancy by a distant relative,\n",
      "   who brought her up in his own house until she was twelve years\n",
      "   old. Thinking, however, that it would be better for the child\n",
      "   to have playmates of her own age, he advertised in several\n",
      "   local papers for a good home in a comfortable farmhouse for a\n",
      "   girl of twelve, and this advertisement was answered by Mr. R.,\n",
      "   a well-to-do farmer in the above-mentioned village. His\n",
      "   references proving satisfactory, the gentleman sent his adopted\n",
      "   daughter to Mr. R., with a letter, in which he stipulated that\n",
      "   the girl should have a room to herself, and stated that her\n",
      "   guardians need be at no trouble in the matter of education, as\n",
      "   she was already sufficiently educated for the position in life\n",
      "   which she would occupy. In fact, Mr. R. was given to understand\n",
      "   that the girl be allowed to find her own occupations and to\n",
      "   spend her time almost as she liked. Mr. R. duly met her at the\n",
      "   nearest station, a town seven miles away from his house, and\n",
      "   seems to have remarked nothing extraordinary about the child\n",
      "   except that she was reticent as to her former life and her\n",
      "   adopted father. She was, however, of a very different type from\n",
      "   the inhabitants of the village; her skin was a pale, clear\n",
      "   olive, and her features were strongly marked, and of a somewhat\n",
      "   foreign character. She appears to have settled down easily\n",
      "   enough into farmhouse life, and became a favourite with the\n",
      "   children, who sometimes went with her on her rambles in the\n",
      "   forest, for this was her amusement. Mr. R. states that he has\n",
      "   known her to go out by herself directly after their early\n",
      "   breakfast, and not return till after dusk, and that, feeling\n",
      "   uneasy at a young girl being out alone for so many hours, he\n",
      "   communicated with her adopted father, who replied in a brief\n",
      "   note that Helen must do as she chose. In the winter, when the\n",
      "   forest paths are impassable, she spent most of her time in her\n",
      "   bedroom, where she slept alone, according to the instructions\n",
      "   of her relative. It was on one of these expeditions to the\n",
      "   forest that the first of the singular incidents with which this\n",
      "   girl is connected occurred, the date being about a year after\n",
      "   her arrival at the village. The preceding winter had been\n",
      "   remarkably severe, the snow drifting to a great depth, and the\n",
      "   frost continuing for an unexampled period, and the summer\n",
      "   following was as noteworthy for its extreme heat. On one of the\n",
      "   very hottest days in this summer, Helen V. left the farmhouse\n",
      "   for one of her long rambles in the forest, taking with her, as\n",
      "   usual, some bread and meat for lunch. She was seen by some men\n",
      "   in the fields making for the old Roman Road, a green causeway\n",
      "   which traverses the highest part of the wood, and they were\n",
      "   astonished to observe that the girl had taken off her hat,\n",
      "   though the heat of the sun was already tropical. As it\n",
      "   happened, a labourer, Joseph W. by name, was working in the\n",
      "   forest near the Roman Road, and at twelve o’clock his little\n",
      "   son, Trevor, brought the man his dinner of bread and cheese.\n",
      "   After the meal, the boy, who was about seven years old at the\n",
      "   time, left his father at work, and, as he said, went to look\n",
      "   for flowers in the wood, and the man, who could hear him\n",
      "   shouting with delight at his discoveries, felt no uneasiness.\n",
      "   Suddenly, however, he was horrified at hearing the most\n",
      "   dreadful screams, evidently the result of great terror,\n",
      "   proceeding from the direction in which his son had gone, and he\n",
      "   hastily threw down his tools and ran to see what had happened.\n",
      "   Tracing his path by the sound, he met the little boy, who was\n",
      "   running headlong, and was evidently terribly frightened, and on\n",
      "   questioning him the man elicited that after picking a posy of\n",
      "   flowers he felt tired, and lay down on the grass and fell\n",
      "   asleep. He was suddenly awakened, as he stated, by a peculiar\n",
      "   noise, a sort of singing he called it, and on peeping through\n",
      "   the branches he saw Helen V. playing on the grass with a\n",
      "   “strange naked man,” who he seemed unable to describe more\n",
      "   fully. He said he felt dreadfully frightened and ran away\n",
      "   crying for his father. Joseph W. proceeded in the direction\n",
      "   indicated by his son, and found Helen V. sitting on the grass\n",
      "   in the middle of a glade or open space left by charcoal\n",
      "   burners. He angrily charged her with frightening his little\n",
      "   boy, but she entirely denied the accusation and laughed at the\n",
      "   child’s story of a “strange man,” to which he himself did not\n",
      "   attach much credence. Joseph W. came to the conclusion that the\n",
      "   boy had woke up with a sudden fright, as children sometimes do,\n",
      "   but Trevor persisted in his story, and continued in such\n",
      "   evident distress that at last his father took him home, hoping\n",
      "   that his mother would be able to soothe him. For many weeks,\n",
      "   however, the boy gave his parents much anxiety; he became\n",
      "   nervous and strange in his manner, refusing to leave the\n",
      "   cottage by himself, and constantly alarming the household by\n",
      "   waking in the night with cries of “The man in the wood! father!\n",
      "   father!”\n",
      "\n",
      "   In course of time, however, the impression seemed to have worn\n",
      "   off, and about three months later he accompanied his father to\n",
      "   the home of a gentleman in the neighborhood, for whom Joseph W.\n",
      "   occasionally did work. The man was shown into the study, and\n",
      "   the little boy was left sitting in the hall, and a few minutes\n",
      "   later, while the gentleman was giving W. his instructions, they\n",
      "   were both horrified by a piercing shriek and the sound of a\n",
      "   fall, and rushing out they found the child lying senseless on\n",
      "   the floor, his face contorted with terror. The doctor was\n",
      "   immediately summoned, and after some examination he pronounced\n",
      "   the child to be suffering form a kind of fit, apparently\n",
      "   produced by a sudden shock. The boy was taken to one of the\n",
      "   bedrooms, and after some time recovered consciousness, but only\n",
      "   to pass into a condition described by the medical man as one of\n",
      "   violent hysteria. The doctor exhibited a strong sedative, and\n",
      "   in the course of two hours pronounced him fit to walk home, but\n",
      "   in passing through the hall the paroxysms of fright returned\n",
      "   and with additional violence. The father perceived that the\n",
      "   child was pointing at some object, and heard the old cry, “The\n",
      "   man in the wood,” and looking in the direction indicated saw a\n",
      "   stone head of grotesque appearance, which had been built into\n",
      "   the wall above one of the doors. It seems the owner of the\n",
      "   house had recently made alterations in his premises, and on\n",

      "   terror which hung about him like a mist. He had acknowledged\n",

      "   avowed, had corrupted him body and soul, and Villiers felt that\n",
      "   this man, once his friend, had been an actor in scenes evil\n",
      "   beyond the power of words. His story needed no confirmation: he\n",

      "   Street, off Tottenham Court Road. Of course the police did not\n",
      "   make the discovery; if you happen to be sitting up all night\n",
      "   and have a light in your window, the constable will ring the\n",
      "   bell, but if you happen to be lying dead in somebody’s area,\n",
      "   you will be left alone. In this instance, as in many others,\n",
      "   the alarm was raised by some kind of vagabond; I don’t mean a\n",
      "   common tramp, or a public-house loafer, but a gentleman, whose\n",
      "   business or pleasure, or both, made him a spectator of the\n",
      "   London streets at five o’clock in the morning. This individual\n",
      "   was, as he said, ‘going home,’ it did not appear whence or\n",
      "   whither, and had occasion to pass through Paul Street between\n",
      "   four and five a.m. Something or other caught his eye at Number\n",
      "   20; he said, absurdly enough, that the house had the most\n",
      "   unpleasant physiognomy he had ever observed, but, at any rate,\n",
      "   he glanced down the area and was a good deal astonished to see\n",
      "   a man lying on the stones, his limbs all huddled together, and\n",
      "   his face turned up. Our gentleman thought his face looked\n",
      "   peculiarly ghastly, and so set off at a run in search of the\n",
      "   nearest policeman. The constable was at first inclined to treat\n",
      "   the matter lightly, suspecting common drunkenness; however, he\n",
      "   came, and after looking at the man’s face, changed his tone,\n",
      "   quickly enough. The early bird, who had picked up this fine\n",
      "   worm, was sent off for a doctor, and the policeman rang and\n",
      "   knocked at the door till a slatternly servant girl came down\n",
      "   looking more than half asleep. The constable pointed out the\n",
      "   contents of the area to the maid, who screamed loudly enough to\n",
      "   wake up the street, but she knew nothing of the man; had never\n",
      "   seen him at the house, and so forth. Meanwhile, the original\n",
      "   discoverer had come back with a medical man, and the next thing\n",
      "   was to get into the area. The gate was open, so the whole\n",
      "   quartet stumped down the steps. The doctor hardly needed a\n",
      "   moment’s examination; he said the poor fellow had been dead for\n",
      "   several hours, and it was then the case began to get\n",
      "   interesting. The dead man had not been robbed, and in one of\n",
      "   his pockets were papers identifying him as—well, as a man of\n",
      "   good family and means, a favourite in society, and nobody’s\n",
      "   enemy, as far as could be known. I don’t give his name,\n",
      "   Villiers, because it has nothing to do with the story, and\n",
      "   because it’s no good raking up these affairs about the dead\n",
      "   when there are no relations living. The next curious point was\n",
      "   that the medical men couldn’t agree as to how he met his death.\n",
      "   There were some slight bruises on his shoulders, but they were\n",
      "   so slight that it looked as if he had been pushed roughly out\n",
      "   of the kitchen door, and not thrown over the railings from the\n",
      "   street or even dragged down the steps. But there were\n",
      "   positively no other marks of violence about him, certainly none\n",
      "   that would account for his death; and when they came to the\n",
      "   autopsy there wasn’t a trace of poison of any kind. Of course\n",
      "   the police wanted to know all about the people at Number 20,\n",
      "   and here again, so I have heard from private sources, one or\n",
      "   two other very curious points came out. It appears that the\n",
      "   occupants of the house were a Mr. and Mrs. Charles Herbert; he\n",
      "   was said to be a landed proprietor, though it struck most\n",
      "   people that Paul Street was not exactly the place to look for\n",
      "   country gentry. As for Mrs. Herbert, nobody seemed to know who\n",
      "   or what she was, and, between ourselves, I fancy the divers\n",
      "   after her history found themselves in rather strange waters. Of\n",

      "   course all empty houses are stuffy, and so forth, but this was\n",
      "   something quite different; I can’t describe it to you, but it\n",
      "   seemed to stop the breath. I went into the front room and the\n",
      "   back room, and the kitchens downstairs; they were all dirty and\n",

      "   together, and stood against the end wall, wondering what on\n",
      "   earth there could be about the room to make my limbs tremble,\n",
      "   and my heart beat as if I were at the hour of death. In one\n",
      "   corner there was a pile of newspapers littered on the floor,\n",

      "   years ago, some of them half torn, and some crumpled as if they\n",
      "   had been used for packing. I turned the whole pile over, and\n",
      "   amongst them I found a curious drawing; I will show it to you\n",
      "   presently. But I couldn’t stay in the room; I felt it was\n",
      "   overpowering me. I was thankful to come out, safe and sound,\n",
      "   into the open air. People stared at me as I walked along the\n",
      "   street, and one man said I was drunk. I was staggering about\n",
      "   from one side of the pavement to the other, and it was as much\n",
      "   as I could do to take the key back to the agent and get home. I\n",
      "   was in bed for a week, suffering from what my doctor called\n",
      "   nervous shock and exhaustion. One of those days I was reading\n",
      "   the evening paper, and happened to notice a paragraph headed:\n",
      "   ‘Starved to Death.’ It was the usual style of thing; a model\n",
      "   lodging-house in Marylebone, a door locked for several days,\n",
      "   and a dead man in his chair when they broke in. ‘The deceased,’\n",
      "   said the paragraph, ‘was known as Charles Herbert, and is\n",

      "   and the cornfields, the dull red sun, and the cold white mist\n",
      "   rising from the water. He heard a voice speaking to him across\n",
      "   the waves of many years, and saying “Clarke, Mary will see the\n",
      "   god Pan!” and then he was standing in the grim room beside the\n",
      "   doctor, listening to the heavy ticking of the clock, waiting\n",
      "   and watching, watching the figure lying on the green chair\n",
      "   beneath the lamplight. Mary rose up, and he looked into her\n",

      "   consulted me the other night, and my advice to you is this.\n",
      "   Throw the portrait into the fire, blot out the story from your\n",
      "   mind. Never give it another thought, Villiers, or you will be\n",
      "   sorry. You will think, no doubt, that I am in possession of\n",
      "   some secret information, and to a certain extent that is the\n",
      "   case. But I only know a little; I am like a traveller who has\n",
      "   peered over an abyss, and has drawn back in terror. What I know\n",
      "   is strange enough and horrible enough, but beyond my knowledge\n",
      "   there are depths and horrors more frightful still, more\n",
      "   incredible than any tale told of winter nights about the fire.\n",
      "   I have resolved, and nothing shall shake that resolve, to\n",
      "   explore no whit farther, and if you value your happiness you\n",
      "   will make the same determination.\n",
      "       “Come and see me by all means; but we will talk on more\n",
      "   cheerful topics than this.”\n",
      "\n",

      "   Villiers.\n",

      "   sensation in that room!” he said at length. “I hardly gather\n",

      "   repulsion, in short.”\n",
      "\n",
      "   “No, it was more physical than mental. It was as if I were\n",

      "   “Yes, yes, very strange certainly. You see, your friend\n",

      "   of the best people have taken her up. I hear she has some\n",

      "   himself, in the frightful Walpurgis Night of evil, strange\n",

      "   Lord Argentine was a great favourite in London Society. At\n",
      "   twenty he had been a poor man, decked with the surname of an\n",
      "   illustrious family, but forced to earn a livelihood as best he\n",
      "   could, and the most speculative of money-lenders would not have\n",
      "   entrusted him with fifty pounds on the chance of his ever\n",
      "   changing his name for a title, and his poverty for a great\n",
      "   fortune. His father had been near enough to the fountain of\n",
      "   good things to secure one of the family livings, but the son,\n",
      "   even if he had taken orders, would scarcely have obtained so\n",
      "   much as this, and moreover felt no vocation for the\n",
      "   ecclesiastical estate. Thus he fronted the world with no better\n",
      "   armour than the bachelor’s gown and the wits of a younger son’s\n",
      "   grandson, with which equipment he contrived in some way to make\n",
      "   a very tolerable fight of it. At twenty-five Mr. Charles\n",
      "   Aubernon saw himself still a man of struggles and of warfare\n",
      "   with the world, but out of the seven who stood before him and\n",
      "   the high places of his family three only remained. These three,\n",
      "   however, were “good lives,” but yet not proof against the Zulu\n",
      "   assegais and typhoid fever, and so one morning Aubernon woke up\n",
      "   and found himself Lord Argentine, a man of thirty who had faced\n",
      "   the difficulties of existence, and had conquered. The situation\n",
      "   amused him immensely, and he resolved that riches should be as\n",
      "   pleasant to him as poverty had always been. Argentine, after\n",
      "   some little consideration, came to the conclusion that dining,\n",
      "   regarded as a fine art, was perhaps the most amusing pursuit\n",
      "   open to fallen humanity, and thus his dinners became famous in\n",
      "   London, and an invitation to his table a thing covetously\n",
      "   desired. After ten years of lordship and dinners Argentine\n",
      "   still declined to be jaded, still persisted in enjoying life,\n",
      "   and by a kind of infection had become recognized as the cause\n",
      "   of joy in others, in short, as the best of company. His sudden\n",
      "   and tragical death therefore caused a wide and deep sensation.\n",
      "   People could scarcely believe it, even though the newspaper was\n",
      "   before their eyes, and the cry of “Mysterious Death of a\n",
      "   Nobleman” came ringing up from the street. But there stood the\n",
      "   brief paragraph: “Lord Argentine was found dead this morning by\n",
      "   his valet under distressing circumstances. It is stated that\n",
      "   there can be no doubt that his lordship committed suicide,\n",
      "   though no motive can be assigned for the act. The deceased\n",
      "   nobleman was widely known in society, and much liked for his\n",
      "   genial manner and sumptuous hospitality. He is succeeded by,”\n",
      "   etc., etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "   By slow degrees the details came to light, but the case still\n",
      "   remained a mystery. The chief witness at the inquest was the\n",
      "   deceased’s valet, who said that the night before his death Lord\n",
      "   Argentine had dined with a lady of good position, whose name\n",
      "   was suppressed in the newspaper reports. At about eleven\n",
      "   o’clock Lord Argentine had returned, and informed his man that\n",
      "   he should not require his services till the next morning. A\n",
      "   little later the valet had occasion to cross the hall and was\n",
      "   somewhat astonished to see his master quietly letting himself\n",
      "   out at the front door. He had taken off his evening clothes,\n",
      "   and was dressed in a Norfolk coat and knickerbockers, and wore\n",
      "   a low brown hat. The valet had no reason to suppose that Lord\n",
      "   Argentine had seen him, and though his master rarely kept late\n",
      "   hours, thought little of the occurrence till the next morning,\n",
      "   when he knocked at the bedroom door at a quarter to nine as\n",
      "   usual. He received no answer, and, after knocking two or three\n",
      "   times, entered the room, and saw Lord Argentine’s body leaning\n",
      "   forward at an angle from the bottom of the bed. He found that\n",
      "   his master had tied a cord securely to one of the short\n",
      "   bed-posts, and, after making a running noose and slipping it\n",
      "   round his neck, the unfortunate man must have resolutely fallen\n",
      "   forward, to die by slow strangulation. He was dressed in the\n",
      "   light suit in which the valet had seen him go out, and the\n",
      "   doctor who was summoned pronounced that life had been extinct\n",
      "   for more than four hours. All papers, letters, and so forth\n",
      "   seemed in perfect order, and nothing was discovered which\n",
      "   pointed in the most remote way to any scandal either great or\n",
      "   small. Here the evidence ended; nothing more could be\n",
      "   discovered. Several persons had been present at the\n",
      "   dinner-party at which Lord Argentine had assisted, and to all\n",
      "   these he seemed in his usual genial spirits. The valet, indeed,\n",
      "   said he thought his master appeared a little excited when he\n",
      "   came home, but confessed that the alteration in his manner was\n",
      "   very slight, hardly noticeable, indeed. It seemed hopeless to\n",
      "   seek for any clue, and the suggestion that Lord Argentine had\n",
      "   been suddenly attacked by acute suicidal mania was generally\n",
      "   accepted.\n",

      "   and Mr. Collier-Stuart and Mr. Herries had chosen to die as\n",

      "   tell the truth, Austin, I haven’t paid much attention to the\n",

      "   buried scandal or hidden skeleton would have been brought to\n",

      "   done forty years ago, ‘just before my father died,’ he said. I\n",
      "   got away at last, and walked along sharply; it was a dismal\n",

      "   undergrowth, shadowy and chill, even under the midday sun, and\n",
      "   halting beneath great oaks; lying on the short turf of a\n",
      "   clearing where the faint sweet scent of wild roses came to me\n",

      "   wood stretching far to right and left, and sinking into the\n",
      "   broad level, and beyond, the yellow sea, and the land over the\n",

      "   following hill as wave on wave, and wood and meadow, and\n",
      "   cornfield, and white houses gleaming, and a great wall of\n",
